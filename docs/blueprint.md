# **App Name**: ImpactBoard

## Core Features:

- User Info Display: Display a user information section with profile photo, name, email, welcome message, and a descriptive subtitle.
- Dashboard Stats Cards: Render dashboard statistics using cards in a responsive grid layout.
- Sidebar Menu: Implement a sidebar menu with icons and labels for navigation, highlighting the active page.
- Featured Campaigns: Create a section for featured campaigns with a title, subtitle, and dynamically populated campaign listings. The order in which the campaigns appear should be considered a 'tool' to entice repeat donors. If a new campaign comes on board, make sure repeat donors who haven't given to that campaign get an opportunity to view it first.
- AI Campaign Matching: Personalized Campaign Recommendations: AI-powered 'tool' that recommends campaigns to users based on their donation history and preferences.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to convey trust and sophistication, reflecting a reliable dashboard interface.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#333333) to support the dark theme and reduce eye strain.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to provide a vibrant highlight for interactive elements and active states, ensuring clear visual cues.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern, neutral look.
- Use consistent, minimalist icons from a single set for all sidebar and dashboard elements. Active menu items are highlighted with the accent color.
- Employ a card-based layout with subtle shadows to create depth and hierarchy, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the dashboard.
- Implement subtle animations and transitions for interactive elements, such as button hovers and page transitions, to provide feedback and enhance user experience.
